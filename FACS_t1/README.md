# FACS Error Checking

## File Structure

There are two components to the FACS error checking routines that have been written:

1. readafcs.js
2. facs_examples.html

### readafcs.js

This is a javascript program which parses the CSV data files, looking for a defined set
of key-value pairs as well as the array values for the quadrant data. The data is stored
in a JSON structure, which gets printed to a file. The data is cast to structures read
by the d3-timelines module, with bar code, sample/tube identification, and quadrant
identification being the Y-axis values on 3 different timelines, and these structures
are all printed to different files.

### facs_example.html

This is a web page which uses the javascript D3-timelines package to generate timelines
from the data generated by the readafcs.js program. The data is stored statically inside
the header, but the intent was to eventually merge the functionality of the readafcs.js
script with the display information in this page, to make it dynamic depending on the
CSV files to be loaded.
